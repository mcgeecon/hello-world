# hello-world
This repository is the first one I created. 
My name is Conor McGee. My username is mcgeecon. I studied English and Economics in college, and ultimate frisbee on Mac Field. Those are analytical disciplines that invoke no irony, other than you will observe in the correlation between name and field. I am here to learn and work on the R programming language for statistical analysis.
